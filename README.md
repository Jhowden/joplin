# Joplin

Joplin is a library for flexible datastore migration and seeding.

Joplin tries to solve the problems that arise when dealing with complicated systems consisting of multiple datastores. It lets you define and reason about environments (for instance dev, staging, UAT, prod).

Joplin lets you declare your `databases`, `migrators`, `seed functions` up front and combine them in different `environments`. It can be used via a [leiningen](http://leiningen.org) plugin or be called programatically.

Joplin comes with plugins for SQL/JDBC databases, Datomic, ElasticSearch, Cassandra and Zookeeper. It is built with extensibility in mind, adding more stores is done by a handful of multi-methods.

Joplin is built on top of [ragtime](https://github.com/weavejester/ragtime).

## Libraries

* joplin.core - database independent tools and functions for managing migrations and seeds
* joplin.cassandra - migrate and seed [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) clusters
* joplin.datomic - migrate and seed [Datomic](http://datomic.com) databases
* joplin.elasticsearch - migrate and seed [Elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org) clusters
* joplin.jdbc - migrate and seed SQL databses with jdbc
* joplin.lein - a leiningen plugin run migrations and seeds
* joplin.zookeeper - seed [Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org) clusters

## Installation

Add joplin.core as a dependency if you just want the database-independent core:

```clojure
:dependencies [[joplin.core "0.1.5-SNAPSHOT"]]
```

Or add the full library if you want support for ES/SQL/DT/CASS/ZK databases:

```clojure
:dependencies [[joplin "0.1.5-SNAPSHOT"]]
```

You can also cherry-pick the plugins you need to minimize the dependencies in your classpath. Just include `joplin.core` and the plugins you are interested in.

If you want to integrate Joplin into Leiningen:

```clojure
:plugins [[joplin.lein "0.1.5-SNAPSHOT"]]
```

`joplin.lein` will only add dependencies for the plugins that you are using, i.e. the type of the databases you have defined.

## Usage

### Using Joplin with Leiningen

To use `joplin.lein` you need to define a key called `:joplin` in your `project.clj`. See the [example project](https://github.com/juxt/joplin/blob/master/example/project.clj#L8).

The value of this key must be a map containing the keys `:databases`, `:migrators`, `:seeds` and `:environments`. The first three are pure declarations and `:environments` is where these declarations gets combined. For more details on these 4 keys see the [Concepts](https://github.com/martintrojer/joplin/wiki/concepts).

Once the `:joplin` map has been defined, you can use the joplin leiningen plugin. The plugin comes with 5 commands;

All commands take the name of the environment as their first argument.

- `lein joplin migrate ENV [DB]`

Run all pending (up) migrations on either all databases in the environment of a signle if the DB param us provided. This operation is idempotent.

- `lein joplin seed ENV [DB]`

Run the seed functions on either all databases in the environemnt or a single if the DB param is provided. This operation is NOT idempotent, running seed functions multiple time can lead to duplication of data.

Joplin will only run seed functions on databases that have been fully migrated, i.e. have no pending migrations.

- `lein joplin rollback ENV DB [N]`

Rollback N migrations (down migrate) from a single database in an environemnt. N is an optional agrument and defaults to 1. This command requires that you specify a db.

- `lein joplin reset ENV DB`

Rollback ALL migrations, apply ALL up migrations and call the seed function for a single database in an environment. Intendent to reset a database to a good state. This command require that you specify a db.

Note that reset will only work properly if all down migrations do a complete cleanup of the action taken by the up migration.

- `lein joplin create ENV DB ID`

Create a new migration scaffold file for a single database in an environment. This command requires that you specify both a database and identification string of the migrations.

### Writing migrators

Migrators come in 2 flavours; ragtime-style migrators for :jdbc databases and drift-style migrators for everything else.

#### SQL migrators

A SQL migrator consists of 2 files, one for the up and another for the down migraton. Both must have the same name except for to the up/down part. These files can contain any number of SQL statements but nothing else.

### Writing seed functions

### Calling Joplin from your code

Calling joplin from your code required that you have loaded the `joplin.core` namespace and also the namespaces of the database plugins you intend to use. Then you can call one of 5 multimethods to perform the same 5 actions as described above to the leiningen plugin. The mutimethods are; `joplin.core/migrate-db`, `joplin.core/rollback-db`, `joplin.core/seed-db`, `joplin.core/reset-db`, `joplin.core/create-migration`.

All the multimethods takes a `target` map as it's first argument and additional optional arguments.

The target map must have this shape;
```
{:db {:type DB-TYPE, setting1: DB-SETTINGS, :setting2: DB-SETTING}
 :migrator "path to a folder on the classpath"
 :seed "name of a var in a namespace on the classpath"
 }
 ```

The `:migrator` and/or `:seed` keys are optional (joplin can't do much if both are missing). The `:DB-SETTING` keys vary for the different database types.

For example;
```
{:db {:type :dt, :url "datomic:mem://test"}
 :migrator "joplin/migrators/datomic"
 :seed "seeds.dt/run"
}
```

Valid database types are `:jdbc, :es, :zk, :dt, :cass`. Note that it's easy to [extend joplin]() to handle more database types and thus introduce more valid database types.
